# DeCleanup Network Landing Page

Welcome to the open-source landing page project for [DeCleanup Network](https://decleanup.net) — a decentralized impact movement focused on tokenizing real-world environmental cleanups.

## 🧩 Project Purpose

This repo is for building the public-facing **landing page** of DeCleanup, which introduces the project, explains how it works, and links to our core tools (dApp, Litepaper, Docs).

## 🧑‍🎨 Design Notes

- This landing page must **visually align with the existing DeCleanup dApp**, which is already designed in Figma.
- We have:
  - ✅ A Figma file with the full **DeCleanup dApp design** - [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/gcIv3YALbv8eFTJjXm3aUK/DCU-%E2%80%94-V2-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=lNZyY6zfO7qvKXgD-1)
  - 🧪 A **separate Figma for the landing page**, currently in the beginning of the process and needing contributors to fix and finalize - [Link](https://www.figma.com/design/gcIv3YALbv8eFTJjXm3aUK/DCU-%E2%80%94-V2-(Copy)?node-id=0-1&t=lNZyY6zfO7qvKXgD-1)
- We’re aiming for a clean, clear, professional, and climate-conscious aesthetic.
- Font, button styles, and color palette must stay consistent with the dApp design.
